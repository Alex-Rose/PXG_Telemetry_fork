PXG F1 Telemetry is a tool to record, review and analyse UDP telemetry data from Codemasters F1 2018.

## Features

F1 Telemetry is able to analyse laps and stints (multiple consecutive laps) of every drivers in the session (human or a.i.).

It allows you to :

- Compare your lap with the A.I. or other drivers to improve your driving
- Refine your setups
- Prepare your own practice programmes 

Data of the selected drivers is recorded on the hard drive during the session and can be reviewed later. There is no real time display !
