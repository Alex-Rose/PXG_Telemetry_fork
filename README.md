PXG F1 Telemetry is a tool to record, review and analyse UDP telemetry data from Codemasters F1 2019.

## Features

F1 Telemetry is able to analyse laps, stints (multiple consecutive laps) and races of every drivers in the session (human or a.i.).

It allows you to :

- Compare your laps with the A.I. or other drivers to improve your driving
- Refine your setups
- Prepare your own practice programmes 
- Analyse what happend during a race

Data of the selected drivers is recorded on the hard drive during the sessions and can be reviewed later. There is no real time display !
